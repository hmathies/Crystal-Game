<h3>Directions: </h3>

The objective of the game is to guess the exact number.  If you guess over the number, you lose.

1. Click on any of the four olympians, which have hidden numeric values. This becomes your score. Each olympian has a
different random value between 1-12.
2. Keep clicking any combination of olympians (of your choosing) and try to get the value to add up to the 'Number to Guess'.
3. You win and the game starts over if your value adds up to the 'Number to Guess'.  You lose if you go over the 'Number to
Guess', it is marked as a loss and the game starts over.  
4. The game will always start over with a new 'Number to Guess' and each olympian will be assigned a new value.
